Based on your script, which involves generating podfile entries and comparing Podfile.lock files, here's a README outline that explains how to use it. You can customize this template to better fit your script's specifics and requirements.

# Podfile Utilities Script

This script provides utilities for iOS development with CocoaPods, including generating podfile entries for new dependencies and comparing differences between `Podfile.lock` files. It's designed to facilitate the management of dependencies in large-scale iOS projects.

## Features

- **Generate Podfile Entries**: Automatically generates podfile entries for dependencies specified in a configuration file.
- **Compare Podfile.lock Files**: Compares two `Podfile.lock` files and highlights the added or removed dependencies, similar to a git diff.

## Requirements

- Ruby (version 2.5 or later)
- JSON files for specifying dependencies

## Usage

### Generating Podfile Entries

To generate new podfile entries based on a JSON configuration:

```shell
ruby script.rb gen_pod --lockPath <path_to_Podfile.lock> --depWay <path_or_branch> --configPath <path_to_config.json>
```

- `lockPath`: Path to your `Podfile.lock`.
- `depWay`: Specify "path" or "branch" to indicate how the dependencies are to be fetched.
- `configPath`: Path to your JSON configuration file listing the dependencies.

**Example JSON Configuration (`gen_pod_config.json`):**

```json
{
  "A": {
    "branch": "release",
    "path": "/path/to/A",
    "git_url": "git@github.com:Example/A.git"
  },
  "B": {
    "branch": "release",
    "path": "/path/to/B",
    "git_url": "git@github.com:Example/B.git"
  }
}
```

### Comparing Podfile.lock Files

To compare two `Podfile.lock` files and list differences in dependencies:

```shell
ruby script.rb dif_pod --oldLockPath <path_to_old_Podfile.lock> --newLockPath <path_to_new_Podfile.lock> [--configPath <path_to_config.json>]
```

- `oldLockPath`: Path to the older `Podfile.lock`.
- `newLockPath`: Path to the newer `Podfile.lock`.
- `configPath` (optional): Path to a JSON configuration file specifying which libraries to include in the comparison.

**Example JSON Configuration (`dif_pod_config.json`):**

```json
[
  "A",
  "B"
]
```

## Configuration

The configuration file for generating podfile entries should list each dependency along with its fetch method (path or branch) and relevant details. For comparing `Podfile.lock` files, the configuration file (optional) should list the names of the libraries to be included in the comparison.

## Notes

- Ensure the JSON configuration files are correctly formatted and located at the specified path.
- The script provides output similar to git diff, with dependencies being added marked in green and those being removed marked in red.
